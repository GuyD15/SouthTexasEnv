                <br>
                <p>Preventive care for your septic system can save you a lot of money. Our professionals listed below some suggestions for homeowners that can help you to reduce service calls and replace parts less often.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="left">
                    <h3>Do's</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep adequate chlorine in the chlorination device at all times to maintain the system properly</li>
                        <li>Spread out doing laundry over a period of days since doing it all in one day can overload your system</li>
                        <li>Pump your aerobic unit every two-to-four years depending on use</li>
                        <li>Clean the system completely (all three chambers) when it is pumped. Partial cleaning will lead to having your system pumped more than needed</li>
                        <li>Contact South Texas Environmental whether you need Texas State mandatory inspection, liquid chlorinators in Waller, a Hoot door in Brazoria or almost any other septic system part, service or maintenance</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="right">
                    <h3>Don'ts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use your garbage disposal excessively since this puts excess organic material in your system that will not biodegrade</li>
                        <li>Flush bleach products or cleaning material down the sink because this kills beneficial bacteria and will cause your system to have an odor</li>
                        <li>Use liquid fabric softeners because they bind the organics in the system and donâ€™t allow them to biodegrade</li>
                    </ul>
